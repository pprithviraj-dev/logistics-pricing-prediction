# Consignment Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project explores a real-world dataset from the logistics industry to predict **consignment pricing** using classical machine learning techniques. The logistics analytics market is growing rapidly, and predictive insights can help organizations optimize their supply chains, reduce costs, and improve service delivery.

## Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to:
- Predict consignment prices using available features in the dataset
- Apply machine learning algorithms to build reliable and explainable models
- Maintain clean, testable, and modular code following PEP8 standards

---

## Dataset

The dataset includes historical consignment and delivery records.  
> **Note:** The dataset file (`(raw_data)SCMS_Delivery_History_Dataset.csv`) is included in this repository.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Exploration**
   - Analyze structure, data types, and distributions
2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values, remove duplicates
3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Encode categorical features and prepare the data for modeling
4. **Model Building**
   - Trained using two algorithms:
     - Linear Regression
     - Random Forest Regressor
5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Compared model performance using evaluation metrics like MAE, RMSE
6. **Visualization**
   - Used `matplotlib` to visualize key trends and model results
